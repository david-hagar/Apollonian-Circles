Apollonian-Circles
==================

Draws a set of tangential circles similar to a Smith Chart (just because it looks cool) . More info at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_chart and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_circles


The code also includes a print function that is activated from the menu. This renders it a printer resolution.

Also when running the render can take a while (it draws allot that it doesn't need to off the edge of the screen).
